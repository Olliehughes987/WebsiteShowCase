      <h2>What is wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Wellbeing is defined as <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/well_being">The state of being comfortable, healthy, or happy</a>.</p>
      <p><a href=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/#References>
         1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year in England.</a> Together, we can work to decrease this number by providing the support and knowledge needed for people to seek help.</p>
      <p>One of the problems is the stigma attatched to reaching out for help and support, this leads to many young adults being too afraid to ask for the help they need.</p>
