      <p><a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/depression">Depression is a constant feeling of sadness and loss of interest, which stops you doing your normal activities.</a>
          This can come in many forms, such as a lack of energy or motivation to achieve daily tasks. Depression can also affect people's social lives as they may feel unable to participate in group activities.</p>
      <p>Depression is often misread as the person being lazy or unmotivated, which means that it can lie hidden for years. This leads to further problems down the rode as stress and low mood can build up over the years.</p>
