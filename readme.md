# P2421386 Front End Web Development

This website was created by Oliver Hughes for the CTEC3905 module for DeMontfort
University. It is created using base HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The code has been developed with a preferred line length of 80 characters to
ensure that the code stays neat and readable. I have also used sectioning
wherever appropriate and alt tags on images to help improve accessibility
throughout the website.  

The website was created with mobile first in mind, this means that it is
fully functional on mobile and has been scaled up and modified to work on
desktop. This provides a responsive feel to the website while allowing for any
device to work with it.
